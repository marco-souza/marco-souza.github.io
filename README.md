Welcome to my personal site!

It was built with `solidjs`, `unocss`, `vitejs`, and custom plugins to read filesystem data data in compile time.

Other features
- auto deploy with Github Actions
- uses Github Pages + custom URL (https://marco.tremtec.com)
- uses `pnpm`
- uses `prettier` as formatter

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
