  Hello, my name is **Marco Ant√¥nio**, and I build software for the web **for more than 10 years**.

  Most of my experiences come from building frontend-heavy apps, extensively working with **Typescript/JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **React**. But in my career, I used many different hats, so I also have experience working as a **Backend Engineer**, and **Cloud Engineer**, creating high availability services in great companies, *including [Amazon](https://amazon.com)*.

  Nowadays, I spend my free time building new careers at *[PodCodar](https://podcodar.com)*, a technology education community focused on training professionals.

  *Thanks* for visiting my resume, and I hope we have a chance to connect! üòÅ
