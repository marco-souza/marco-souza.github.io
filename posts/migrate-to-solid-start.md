I recently migrated my web application from SolidJS to Solid-Start, a starter kit for building SolidJS applications. Here's a rundown of the changes I made:

- **Update dependencies:** I updated my project dependencies to match those of Solid-Start, which included newer versions of SolidJS and other packages.

- **Setup Solid-Start:** I followed the Solid-Start documentation to set up my application with its recommended folder structure and build tools.

- **Reuse components:** I reused components such as the Home and NotFound pages, which required some minor adjustments to match the Solid-Start structure.

- **Share components:** I refactored my code to share components between pages where possible. For example, I moved the meta data to the root.tsx layout to avoid duplication.

- **Add 404 page:** I added a 404 page to handle non-existent routes.

- **Local plugins:** I set up local plugins for Solid-Start to extend its functionality.

- **Separate PR workflow:** I added a separate workflow for pull requests to ensure that tests were run before merging.

- **Rename PR job:** I renamed the job for pull request workflows to better reflect its purpose.

- **Run on pull request created:** I configured my GitHub Action to run on pull requests created, in addition to pushes.

- **Migrate to Solid-Start:** I replaced my SolidJS implementation with the equivalent Solid-Start implementation, making any necessary changes to fit the new structure.

Overall, the migration to Solid-Start was a smooth process, and I'm pleased with the result. If you're looking to build a SolidJS application, I'd definitely recommend checking it out!
